                                    Toronto, the capital city of Ontario, is also the largest city in Canada, the fourth largest city in North America. Toronto is not only the center of Canadian culture and economy, but also the traffic hub city and the country's most manufacturing city. Since the crime rate is quite low and environment is pleasant, Toronto is considered as one of the world's most livable cities. Toronto's educational resources are also very rich. It has been a dream of many Chinese students to study abroad. The city has the famous University of Toronto, York University, Ryerson University, and Seneca College; nearby has University of Waterloo, Queen's University, and University of Western Ontario. Meanwhile, Toronto is a multicultural city. The Chinese culture is everywhere. In the other side of Toronto city, it is the state of New York of United States.  The world-famous Niagara Falls is also only 100 kilometers away from the city of Toronto.
